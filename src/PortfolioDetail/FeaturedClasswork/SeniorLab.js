    <h1>Senior Lab (Letter Graded: B-)</h1>
    <p>One of the Senior Lab Projects that I picked is notoriously difficult, yet not impossible.</p>
    <br/>
    <p>Laser Diode Spectroscopy is an open-ended lab that does not ask you any questions, but it asks you 
        if you can produce the desired results.
    </p>
    <br/>
    <p>In that lab alone, I had been exposed to, and mastered the skill of operating a low power IR laser with external Bragg's 
        cavity which requires tuning in order to optically pump the Rubidium gas in the Helmholtz coil cell at its appropriate wavelength to 
        demonstrate the hyperfine splitting of the different Isotopes of Rubidium in the cell, Rb85 and Rb87.

        One point worth noting in particular is that saturation spectroscopy can reveal the photons' behavior and sheds light on how the gas 
        is too excited. While Saturation spectroscopy may have a similar setup to photoluminescence spectroscopy, they are fundamentally different.
