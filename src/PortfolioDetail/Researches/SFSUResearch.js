        <p> 
          In the summer of 2019, I was part of the ASPIRES Internship and was put in the Civil Engineering group to 
          help set up the mitigation lab through the means of installing hardwares and establishing an interface for 
          computers to interact with.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p> 
          I also collected, rearranged, and filtered large sets of data (over 5 trials for the 200+ different nodes)
          by using MATLAB and incorporated some of the pre-existing python codes into our "program".
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            Our work at the time was directly contributed to Professor Jiang's immediate research, and some of its 
            effort went directly towards a Senior Project for some Civil Engineering students.
