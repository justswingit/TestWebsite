      <h1> Dr. Shuji Nakamura's undergrad research intern at UCSB</h1>
      <p>
        During my 1 year of research experience at Nakamura's lab, I was in charge of characterization
        work through the means of Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM), X-Ray Diffraction (XRD), and Hall measurements.
      </p>
      <br/>
      <p>
        I also had shadowed the process of using Scanning Electron Microscope to find possible alloy defects,
        MOCVD Maintenance, MBE operations, quick-testing with Optical Spectrometer for measurements of peak
        wavelengths for LEDs and lasers, as well as some wire-bonding in packaging.
      </p>
      <br/>
      <p>
        Self-imposed lots of other readings, including Larry Coldren's Textbook on laser, one review journal on UV-LED technology, 
        bridging E&M, Quantum Mechanics, Condensed Matter and Semiconductor Physics altogether. 
      </p>
