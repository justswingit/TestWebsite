    <h1>About This (Not-so-serious-yet-pretty-prolific) Website</h1>
    <p>
        As a non-traditional student, with a complete 180 turn in both personality, 
        and college major/career paths, I realized to myself that my immigration 
        had an expected impact of unpredictable outcomes. One of the 
        biggest and most unexpected change is that I become somewhat of a nerd, and I
        am kind of proud of it; One thing that did not change is that I am still driven 
        by what I am passionate about, and am actively pursuing it. This website should 
        be pretty self-explanatory. I don't know what this is going to translate to or 
        where this is gonna go, but I'm going where this amount of effort will lead me to.
